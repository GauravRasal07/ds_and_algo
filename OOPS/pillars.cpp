/*
There are 4 main pillars of OOPs
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
*/

/* 
1. Encapsulation
Information / Data Hiding
Wrapping up of the data members and functions together.
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and code of a class inside a single unit.
Fully encapsulated class is achieved by making the data members and functions private.
Encapsulation is achieved by making the data and code private and providing public accessor methods.


Advantages:
1. Encapsulation is a good practice to keep the data and code of a class separate.
2. Encapsulation is a good practice to hide the implementation details of a class.
3. Privacy
4. We can make a class read only.

When we implement class Encapsulation is achieved.


2. Inheritance
Inheriting data members / methods of one class(parent class) into other class(child class)


Advantages:
1. Code reusability


Table for access modifiers(levels) of parent data members and methods in child class 

                public      protected      private
    
    public      public      protected      private    

    protected   protected   protected       private

    private             Not Accesible


The private members of class cannot be inherited.
